Numerical Methods Presentation Format
-------------------------------------
Problem introduction
----Real world examples to motivate a problem
----Discussion of traditional clustering techniques
Problem Statement
----Interpretations of problem (graph, data set, etc)
----Description of relevant spectral graph theory topics
----Description of NP-Hard problems
----DIscussion of why clustering techniques count as a numerical method (discrete space stuff?)
Numerical Methods Used
----QR Algorithm
----Other eigenvector method? (if time....shit....)
----MATLAB eig method
----Spectral Clustering
--------Different approaches to spectral clustering (normed, etc, be sure to include relevant analysis in terms of graph spectra)
--------Different similarity scoring and parameters
--------State optimization problem
----K-Means
--------State optimization problem
Performance Analysis (mostly big O)
----QR vs MATLAB vs Other...(shit, maybe)
Evaluation
----Difficulty involved, dependent on data
----Evaluation done
----Pretty graphs
Conclusion
----Discussion of eigen analysis in general, unique properties it affords
----Discussion of usefulness of spectral clustering
